Description: Rserve is a versatile, scalable server enabling the
	     efficient use of R from other applications through
	     variety of protocols including QAP, WebSockets, HTTP
	     and HTTPS. It acts as a server (TCP/IP or local sockets) 
	     which allows binary requests to be sent to R. Every
	     connection has a separate workspace and working
	     directory. Client-side implementations are available
	     for many popular languages allowing applications
	     to use facilities of R without the need of linking to
	     the R binary. Rserve supports remote connections,
	     user authentication and file transfer. A simple R client
	     is included in this package as well. It also supports
	     OCAP mode for secure remote procedure calls,
	     including support for full event loop, asynchronous
	     results/graphics and console I/O.
